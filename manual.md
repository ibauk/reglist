# Rally info spreadsheet

Entrant data all begins at the point when they sign up for the event using the relevant Wufoo form. All those entries are checked and corrected where necessary by either Phil or Bob so that the Wufoo dataset always holds the latest and most accurate information.  This spreadsheet extracts that data automagically directly from the Wufoo dataset and reformats it ready for use either as a source of statistics or as forms suitable for registration, check-out, check-in and merchandising processes. A separate automatic process produces fully populated registration/disclaimer forms as well as finisher certificates.

The front "Overview" tab is intended as a quick check page, with access to most information in one place.

The "Money" tab has live cells for input of amounts received at registration reflected in totals and on the Stats tab. The '!!!' column contains code to self-check the sheet ensuring that it adds up correctly and highlights unpaid amounts.

The "Checkouts" tab is intended for "carpark check-out, check-in" use while the "Registration" tab provides a more comprehensive checklist.
